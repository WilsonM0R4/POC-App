# POC-App
Technical test.


This app makes a request to a restaurants API (distributed by Postman: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12204297/TVKJwEWL#e2d6e76c-9c72-47ae-a5fe-120fd962a684)

Once the data is received, it is used to fill a table on the home view. Each item of the table can be marked as a favorite, and those are displayed in the favorites view. When an item is selected, a detail window will open, displaying more information about the selected restaurant.
